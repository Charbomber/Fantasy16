# Fantasy16
A fantasy console based on the 16-bit era.

As of the time of writing, I only plan to work on this myself, but a friend is helping me with the sound system (thank you so much if you're reading this, by the way).
Go get Pico-8, that stuff jams. Or, like, Tic-80 if you are poor like me.



# Made with LOVE. Literally, though.

For those who want to build their own version:

You don't have to. Love just lets you drag and drop the project folder onto it and run it as-is, so, have fun, I guess.
